# The Modulated Structures dictionary

A repository for developing CIF definitions for describing modulated and composite structures. Do
not rely on the contents of this repository for authoritative information about data names. You
may rely on released versions, or versions found on 
[the IUCr website](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/cif_ms) for this purpose.

## Contributing

Please feel free to raise issues, including asking questions about dictionary usage 
and suggestions of new data names, using the usual Github mechanisms. Participation
in ongoing discussions of issues and PRs is also welcome.
